# [MIDI WebSocket](https://github.com/hhromic/midi-websocket)
*One of [several ESP32 repositories](https://github.com/blekenbleu/arduino-esp32#readme)*

A general purpose MIDI over WebSocket approach.  
Includes Node.js client and server as well as JavaScript for browser client.  
Since we may also want to handle some MIDI within the server,  
consider also [MIDI Utilities for JavaScript](https://github.yuuza.net/hhromic/midi-utils-js)
